# WindowsApp-VisualAssets
Are you developing a Windows Store application and do you find annoying to create all visual asset images?
This is simple tool to generate visual assets for applications for Windows 10, Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.1. It creates set of PNG images from SVG graphics.

This application uses Svg2Xaml library. I found some issues with library and not all SVG files are perfectly supported.
Also be aware that Svg2Xaml is licensed under GNU.
